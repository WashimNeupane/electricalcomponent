# electricalcomponent
Mathematical modelling of the heat distribution in the component, solve it numerically using MATLAB, and report about the efficieny of algorithms, storage methods, error rate. 

This project was done in group as an assignment for MXB222: Computational Linear Algebra due on 31st October, 2018. All the code in this document have been created by me and my group for this assignment.
